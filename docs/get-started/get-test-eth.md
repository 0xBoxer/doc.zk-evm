# Get test ETH

ConsenSys zk-EVM has a bridge on the Ethereum Goerli testnet. You therefore need Goerli ETH to bridge funds
to the ConsenSys zk-EVM rollup.

Use a faucet to obtain Goerli ETH. Transactions are much cheaper than mainnet, therefore 0.1 ETH is enough
to execute the basic workflow. The [Faucetlink website contains a list of faucets](https://faucetlink.to/goerli)
for the Goerli network.
