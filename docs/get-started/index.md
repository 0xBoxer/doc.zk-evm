# Get started

You can use the ConsenSys zk-EVM testnet only after [successfully registering](../index.md#how-do-i-join-the-private-testnet).

You can freely test the ConsenSys zk-EVM testnet, however, here are the steps for those looking for a
recommended guide:

1. [Collect Goerli test ETH](get-test-eth.md).
1. Add ConsenSys zk-EVM to your MetaMask wallet.
1. Bridge from Goerli to ConsenSys zk-EVM.
1. Transfer tokens between wallets.
1. Use the Uniswap v3 fork to swap tokens and provide liquidity.
1. View the status of your transactions on our block explorer.
1. Bridge from ConsenSys zkEVM back to Goerli.
