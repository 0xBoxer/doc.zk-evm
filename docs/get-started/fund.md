# Fund your wallet

Use the [MetaMask wallet](Getting started with MetaMask) to store your funds and interact with
ConsenSys zkEVM. You can [install MetaMask as a browser extension or mobile app](https://metamask.io/download/).

ConsenSys zk-EVM uses a bridge on the Ethereum Goerli testnet to transfer funds between the networks.
You therefore need Goerli ETH to use the bridge and ConsenSys zkEVM.

Use a faucet to obtain Goerli ETH. Transactions are much cheaper than mainnet, therefore 0.1 ETH is enough
to execute the basic workflow. You can [view a list of faucets](https://faucetlink.to/goerli)
for the Goerli network.
