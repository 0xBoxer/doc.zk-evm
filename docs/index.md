# ConsenSys zkEVM

## What's ConsenSys zkEVM?

ConsenSys zkEVM is a type 2 zero knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM). A zkEVM replicates
the Ethereum environment as a rollup, and allows developers to build on it as they would on Ethereum mainnet.

## Why use ConsenSys zkEVM?

ConsenSys zkEVM allows developers to deploy any smart contract, use any tool, and develop as if
they were building on Ethereum. For users, this enables the experience and security guarantees
of Ethereum, but with far lower transaction costs.

## How do I join the private testnet?

If youâ€™re interested in joining this private testnet, then [join the waiting list](https://consensys-software.typeform.com/rollups).
Dapp developers, users, researchers, and existing protocols are encouraged to join and help scale Ethereum.

Once your wallet address is granted access, you'll be allowed to bridge to the zkEVM network and begin
using it. Until then, please wait for an email to confirm that your account has access.

## How do I report issues?

ConsenSys zkEVM is a beta testnet aiming to catch bugs and resolve issues in a controlled environment that does
not expose any risk to users. Security is the number one priority. If, during your testing, you
encounter any problems, please fill out our form to report an issue. You can also post your problem
in the Discord channel under the official ConsenSys discord. The more information you can provide
the better: transaction Id, screenshots, and detailed steps taken to reproduce the bug will help
resolve the issues quicker.
