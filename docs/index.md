# ConsenSys zkEVM

ConsenSys zkEVM is a type 2 zero knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM). A zkEVM replicates the Ethereum environment as a rollup, and allows developers to build on it as they would on Ethereum mainnet. The ConsenSys zkEVM network allows you to deploy any smart contract, use any tool, and develop as if you're building on Ethereum. For users, this enables the experience and security guarantees of Ethereum, but with lower transaction costs.

## How do I join the private testnet?

Sign ups for the private testnet are closed. If your wallet was granted access, you should have received a confirmation email. Afterwards, you'll be allowed to bridge funds and begin using the ConsenSys zkEVM network.
