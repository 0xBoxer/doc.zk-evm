# ConsenSys zk-EVM

ConsenSys R&D has a deep experience with rollups, exploring trustless transfers between rollups back
in 2019, before formalizing the first account-based anonymous rollup which we later extended to a
partially-anonymous rollup.

After identifying the challenges discussed above, we spent the last years developing a Type 2
EVM-equivalent zk-EVM. We hope this latest contribution will complement the great work by other teams
in the ecosystem, such as Polygon zk-EVM and Scroll, and complete the possible infrastructural choices
for decentralized application (dApp) developers, startups, and enterprises to choose and scale on Ethereum.

Our team is working hard to implement the full design of the zk-EVM and will soon be launching a private
testnet to receive feedback from the community.
