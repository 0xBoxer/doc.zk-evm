# ConsenSys zk-EVM

## What is ConsenSys zk-EVM?

ConsenSys zk-EVM is a type 2 zero knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zk-EVM). A zk-EVM replicates
the Ethereum environment as a rollup, and allows developers to build on it as they would on Ethereum mainnet.

## Why use ConsenSys zk-EVM?

ConsenSys zk-EVM allows developers to deploy any smart contract, use any tool, and develop exactly as if
they were building on Ethereum. For users, this enables the experience and security guarantees
of Ethereum, but with far lower transaction costs.

## How do I join the private testnet?

If youâ€™re interested in joining this private testnet, then [join our waitlist](https://consensys-software.typeform.com/rollups).
We welcome dapp developers, users, researchers, and existing protocols to join and help us scale Ethereum.

Once your wallet address has been allowlisted you will be able to bridge to the zk-EVM network and begin
using it. Until then, please wait patiently for an email to confirm your account has been granted access.

## How do I report issues?

ConsenSys zk-EVM is a beta testnet aiming to catch bugs and resolve issues in a controlled environment that does
not expose any risk to users. Security is the number one priority. If, during your testing, you
encounter any problems, please fill out our form to report an issue. You can also post your problem
in the Discord channel under the official ConsenSys discord. The more information you can provide
the better: transaction Id, screenshots, and detailed steps taken to reproduce the bug will help us
resolve the problem in a timely manner.
