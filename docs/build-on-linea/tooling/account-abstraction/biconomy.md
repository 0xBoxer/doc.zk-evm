# Superpowers for your Web3 stack

The Biconomy SDK provides solutions from onboarding to user engagement for a decentralized application (dApp) in a non-custodial way. It is a one-stop solution to enable an effortless experience in your dApp as it eases onboarding for new users and abstracts away transaction complexities that your users face on a daily basis. This is enabled using Smart Contract Wallets (SCW) built on top of our multi-chain Relayer Infrastructure.
