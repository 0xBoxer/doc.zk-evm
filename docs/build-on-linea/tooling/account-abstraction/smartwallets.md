thirdweb released their Smart Wallet SDK implementing EIP-4337 and leveraging Pimlico infrastructure for Bundler and Paymaster.

A smart contract wallet is a type of Web3 wallet powered by smart contracts.

This smart wallet is unlocked by a 'key' - a personal account. This key can be anything from a MetaMask wallet or even a Local Wallet and is used as a way to 'sign in' to the wallet.

### Benefits of Smart Wallets:
