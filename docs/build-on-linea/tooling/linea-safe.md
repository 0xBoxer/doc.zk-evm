## What is Linea Safe?

Linea Safe is the GnosisSafe conception on the Linea network. 

The Linea Safe is a smart contract wallet that requires a minimum number of people to approve a transaction before it can occur (M-of-N). If for example you have 3 main stakeholders in your business, you are able to set up the wallet to require approval from 2 out of 3 (2/3) or all 3 people before the transaction is sent. This assures that no single person could compromise the funds.

On top of that, Linea Safe gives complete self custody over funds and the smart contract that is deployed is completely trustless and in control.
