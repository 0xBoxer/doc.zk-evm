# Linea, the land of many bridges

Any L2 is going to have a lot of connections to other networks. Some of these bridges will be made by Consensys and Linea, some by projects collaborating with us; eventually, some may be made without our knowledgeâ€”thatâ€™s what 'permissionless' means.

<aside>

<h3>What's going on here?</h3>
<p>Linea, like any other rollup network, is designed to offer its own experience, while 'reporting back' to another network (usually Ethereum Mainnet) on all the activity that happens on it (at least, at the level of transactions); this means that the 'Layer 1' network is tracking all the activity on the 'Layer 2'. In this way, L2s are said to 'inherit the security of the L1'.
</p>
<p>
One of the main reasons you would want a rollup network is for it to be totally interoperable with the L1, and one of the main things you need to make networks interoperable is enable people to move things back and forth between them. The class of tools used to this, broadly, are called **bridges**.

Ok, now you're up to speed ðŸš€</p>
