 _Note: Partners are currently onboarding to Linea Mainnet Alpha. The network and bridge to Ethereum will be available soon for general use. See here for more details on what to expect._


<!-- Linea is meant to be fully compatible with Ethereum, full stop. There are already a lot of dapps that have deployed to the networkâ€”and if there's one that hasn't deployed (for example, yours ðŸ‘€) we're here to help you get it there.

This section should walk you through everything you need to get started:

1. [Set up your wallet](./set-up-your-wallet.mdx)
2. [Bridge some funds](./bridges-of-linea/index.mdx)
3. [Deploy your first contract](./../build-on-linea/quickstart/)
4. [Get funds from a faucet](./fund.md)
5. [Send a transaction](./transact.md)

If you run into a problem, step on over to the [Linea Support page](https://support.linea.build/hc/en-us) and let us know. -->
