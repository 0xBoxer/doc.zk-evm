If you're new to public blockchain networks, you might not be familiar with _block explorers_. It's helpful to remember that the network is keeping track of a _ledger_ of accounts, with tokens attributed to them, sent between them, created by them, etc. 

So as users take actions on the network, there are changes to those accounts and tokens. A block explorer is an interface through which you can look at that information in all its raw, gritty detail.
