# Report an issue

If during testing, you encounter any issues, please fill out our form to report an issue. You
can also post your issue in the [Discord channel (zkevm-rollup)](https://discord.gg/consensys)
under the official ConsenSys discord. The more information you provide the better: transaction ID,
screenshots, and detailed steps taken to reproduce the issue will help resolve the issues quicker.
